Side project studying responses of people to non state actor attacks

To build my skills and learn something about the world I decided to work on trying to answer the question, "How much does the rest of world care when a 'terror' attack occurs as a function of their location". 

Data will be taken from wikipedia and twitter and I will try and normalize by twitter users per area.
